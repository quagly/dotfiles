# HOME directory files managed by stow

using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks to these files in my home directories

be aware of [stow ignore lists](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/html_node/Types-And-Syntax-Of-Ignore-Lists.html)

probably want to stow stow first avoid having to pass --dotfile every time 
`stow --dotfile stow`

alternative idempotent [home manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/#sec-install-standalone) may be better for some use cases
